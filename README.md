# -CT-Scan-Tumor-Localization---EDA-Baseline-Models-Neural-Network
Exploratory data analysis, baseline modeling, and a custom neural network approach for tumor localization using CT scan image data.
# 🧠 CT Scan Tumor Localization - EDA, Baseline Models & Neural Network

This project focuses on **localizing tumors in CT scan images** using a combination of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **baseline ML models**, and a **custom neural network**. The goal is to accurately detect and localize tumors within scan regions, a critical task in medical imaging and diagnostics.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- In-depth **EDA** of tumor datasets including shape, intensity, and localization stats
- Implementation of **baseline machine learning models**
- Development and training of a **custom convolutional neural network (CNN)**
- Visualizations of model performance and predictions
- Designed for CT image-based **object detection/localization**

## 🧪 Dataset Overview

- **Data Type**: CT scan images and tumor location labels
- **Labels**: Likely includes bounding boxes or center coordinates (X, Y)
- **Tasks**: Localization rather than classification

> Note: Dataset details are abstracted for privacy—replace with real dataset citation if needed.

## 🧠 Models Used

- Baseline models (Linear Regression, etc.) for early experimentation
- Custom-built CNN using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (based on your code)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Intersection over Union (IoU)
  - Visual validation through overlays

## 📊 Visuals and Outputs

- Dataset distribution plots (image shape, pixel intensity, etc.)
- Loss curves for training vs validation
- Predicted bounding box overlays on scan images
- Error analysis for mislocalized tumors
